## Rustwave

### Overview
The project involves porting "Guff," a C-based command-line tool that plots numerical data as ASCII art in the terminal, to Rust. This new Rust version is called Rustwave.

Rustwave aims to provide efficient data visualization, supporting features like plotting X and Y coordinates, or simply Y values with auto-incrementing X.
